# Doctrina LMS - Product Mission

## Vision Statement

Doctrina LMS is a modern, real-time learning management system designed to democratize professional education by providing an intuitive platform where instructors can create engaging courses and learners can achieve their educational goals with measurable outcomes.

## Problem Statement

### Current Market Challenges

1. **Fragmented Learning Experience**: Existing platforms often lack real-time features, requiring page refreshes and creating disconnected experiences between instructors and students.

2. **High Technical Barriers**: Many LMS solutions require extensive technical knowledge to set up and maintain, limiting adoption by individual educators and small organizations.

3. **Limited Engagement Tools**: Traditional platforms focus on content delivery without adequate support for live interaction, community building, and personalized learning paths.

4. **Poor Progress Visibility**: Learners struggle to track their advancement, and instructors lack real-time insights into student engagement and completion rates.
