## For Students: Understanding CE Credits on Doctrina LMS

### What You Need to Know

**Doctrina LMS is an education marketplace, NOT an accredited continuing education provider.**

This is an important distinction that affects how CE credits work on our platform:

✅ **What We DO:**

- Connect you with professional instructors who may offer CE-accredited courses
- Display CE credit information provided by instructors
- Help you filter courses by CE credit availability
- Facilitate certificate generation for CE courses

❌ **What We DON'T Do:**

- Accredit courses or issue CE credits ourselves
- Guarantee CE credit acceptance by any licensing board
- Verify that CE credits will satisfy your specific license requirements
- Act as a CE provider or accrediting body

---

### How CE Credits Work on Doctrina LMS

#### Step 1: Instructor Obtains CE Accreditation

Individual instructors who want to offer CE credits must:

1. Apply for CE provider approval from an accrediting body:
   - **ANCC** (American Nurses Credentialing Center) - for nurses
   - **ACCME** (Accreditation Council for CME) - for physicians
   - **ACPE** (Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education) - for pharmacists
   - **State Nursing Boards** - state-specific CE approval for nurses and nurse practitioners
   - **State Esthetics Boards** - for licensed estheticians (varies by state)
   - **State Medical Boards** - for physicians and physician assistants
   - **Professional associations** - specialty-specific CE approval
   - **Other recognized accrediting organizations**

2. Get their specific course(s) approved by that accrediting body
3. Receive a CE provider number and approval documentation
4. Submit proof of accreditation to Doctrina LMS

#### Step 2: Doctrina Displays CE Information

When an instructor provides proof of CE accreditation, we:

- Display a "CE Credits Available" badge on the course
- Show the number of CE credits offered
- List the accrediting body (e.g., "ANCC-approved")
- Display the CE provider number
- Show approval expiration date (if applicable)

**Example Course Listing:**

```
Advanced Botox & Dermal Fillers Certification
By Dr. Sarah Johnson, MD

✅ 6.0 CE Credits Available
   Accreditation: ANCC Provider #P123456
   Valid through: December 31, 2026
```

#### Step 3: You Verify CE Credits Will Work for Your License

**CRITICAL:** Before enrolling in any course for CE credits, YOU must verify:

**Check with YOUR licensing board:**

1. Go to your state licensing board website (e.g., California Board of Registered Nursing, Texas State Board of Medical Examiners)
2. Review CE requirements for YOUR license renewal
3. Verify they accept CE from the accrediting body listed on the course
4. Confirm the course topic qualifies toward your requirements
5. Check if there are any restrictions or limits

**Important Questions to Ask:**

- Does my state accept ANCC-approved CE credits?
- Is there a limit on online CE hours?
- Does this course topic count toward my specialty requirements?
- Do I need to keep certificates for audit purposes?
- Are there specific CE requirements for medical aesthetics procedures?

**We Cannot Answer These Questions for You**
Every state has different requirements. What counts for license renewal in California may not count in Texas. We provide the course information; YOU are responsible for verifying it meets YOUR needs.

### Common Student Questions

#### Q: If a course on Doctrina LMS offers CE credits, can I use them for my professional license?

**A:** It depends. Check three things:

1. **Does your state accept CE from this accrediting body?** (Most states accept ANCC for nurses, ACCME for physicians, but verify)
2. **Does the course topic qualify?** (E.g., some states require certain percentages in specific topics)
3. **Are there limits on online CE?** (Some states cap online hours)

**You must verify with YOUR state board before enrolling.**

**Examples by Profession:**

- **Registered Nurses (RN):** Check your state Board of Nursing for CE requirements
- **Nurse Practitioners (NP):** May have additional CE requirements beyond RN license
- **Physician Assistants (PA):** Check NCCPA and state medical board requirements
- **Physicians (MD/DO):** Check state medical board and specialty board requirements
- **Licensed Estheticians:** Check your state's Board of Cosmetology or Esthetics Board

#### Q: What if I take a course for CE credits and my board rejects it?

**A:** This is why verification before enrollment is critical. Doctrina LMS is not responsible if CE credits are rejected by your board. We display instructor-provided CE information accurately, but cannot guarantee acceptance by every licensing board.

Some courses may be accepted in certain states but not others. Always verify first.

#### Q: How do I get my CE certificate after completing a course?

**A:** Instructors who offer CE credits will provide a CE certificate upon course completion. This is separate from the Doctrina LMS course completion certificate. The CE certificate will include:

- Your name
- Course title
- CE credit hours earned
- Accrediting body and provider number
- Date of completion
- Instructor's signature or digital signature

Keep this certificate for your license renewal records. Some states audit CE compliance.

#### Q: Do ALL courses on Doctrina LMS offer CE credits?

**A:** No. Only courses where the instructor has obtained CE accreditation will offer CE credits. Many excellent courses on Doctrina LMS do NOT offer CE credits but still provide valuable skills and knowledge for career development.

You can filter courses to show only those offering CE credits if that's important to you.

#### Q: Can I take courses that don't offer CE credits?

**A:** Absolutely! Many healthcare and aesthetics professionals take courses for skill development, practice expansion, or learning new procedures - not just for CE compliance. For example:

- Learning advanced injection techniques to add to your practice
- Business training for opening a medical spa or aesthetics clinic
- Marketing strategies for growing your practice
- Advanced techniques beyond basic certification (lasers, PDO threads, etc.)
- Non-clinical skills (patient consultations, photography, social media)

#### Q: I'm a licensed esthetician. Can I take courses for CE credits?

**A:** Yes! Many states require CE for esthetician license renewal. Check your state's Board of Cosmetology or Esthetics Board for:

- How many CE hours required (typically 4-16 hours per renewal period)
- What topics qualify (health and safety, sanitation, new techniques, etc.)
- Online vs. in-person requirements
- Approved CE providers for your state

Some instructors on Doctrina LMS may have state esthetics board approval for their courses.

#### Q: If I have questions about whether CE credits will work for my license, who do I ask?

**A:** Contact your state licensing board directly. They are the authoritative source for YOUR license requirements. Doctrina LMS and course instructors cannot provide legal guidance on state licensing requirements.

**Find your state board:**

- **Nurses:** Search "[Your State] Board of Nursing"
- **Physicians:** Search "[Your State] Medical Board"
- **Physician Assistants:** Search "[Your State] Medical Board" or "[Your State] PA Licensing"
- **Estheticians:** Search "[Your State] Board of Cosmetology" or "Esthetics Board"
- **Other professions:** Search for your profession's licensing board in your state

### Your Responsibilities as a Student

When enrolling in courses offering CE credits, you acknowledge and agree to:

✅ Verify CE credit acceptance with your licensing board BEFORE enrolling
✅ Keep all CE certificates for your records (audit protection)
✅ Report CE credits to your licensing board according to their requirements
✅ Understand that Doctrina LMS is a marketplace, not a CE provider
✅ Accept that the instructor, not Doctrina LMS, is responsible for CE accreditation

---

## For Instructors: Offering CE Credits on Your Courses

### Can You Offer CE Credits?

**YES** - If you obtain your own CE provider approval from an accrediting body

**NO** - Doctrina LMS platform does not provide or facilitate CE accreditation for you

### How to Offer CE Credits for Your Courses

#### Step 1: Become an Approved CE Provider

You must independently obtain approval from a CE accrediting organization:

**For Nursing Courses (RN, NP, APRN):**

- **ANCC** (American Nurses Credentialing Center): https://www.nursingworld.org/ancc/
  - Apply for "Approved Provider" status
  - Process takes 3-6 months
  - Costs vary ($500-$3,000 depending on program)
  - Requires organizational structure and quality processes

- **State Nursing Boards**: Many states offer CE provider approval
  - Example: California Board of Registered Nursing (CEP number)
  - Generally faster and cheaper than national accreditation
  - May only be valid in that state

**For Physician Courses (MD, DO):**

- **ACCME** (Accreditation Council for CME): https://www.accme.org/
  - Rigorous application process
  - Requires significant infrastructure
  - Or partner with an ACCME-accredited organization

**For Physician Assistant Courses (PA):**

- **AAPA** (American Academy of Physician Assistants): Category 1 CME
- Many PAs accept ACCME-approved CME as well
- State medical boards may have specific requirements

**For Esthetician Courses:**

- **State Cosmetology or Esthetics Boards**: Apply for CE provider approval
  - Requirements vary significantly by state
  - Some states require in-person courses only (check regulations)
  - Costs typically lower than medical CE ($100-$500)
  - May need to offer state-specific content (law, sanitation)

**For Other Professions:**

- Research CE requirements for your target profession
- Identify appropriate accrediting bodies
- Apply for provider status

#### Step 2: Get Your Specific Courses Approved

Even if you're an approved provider, each COURSE must typically be approved:

1. Submit course outline and learning objectives
2. Demonstrate qualified faculty (you)
3. Show how learning will be assessed
4. Pay course approval fees (if applicable)
5. Receive approval number for that specific course

#### Step 3: Submit Proof to Doctrina LMS

Once you have CE approval, submit to Doctrina LMS:

- **CE Provider Number** (from accrediting body)
- **Accrediting Organization** (ANCC, ACCME, state board, etc.)
- **Approved Course Title** (must match your Doctrina LMS course)
- **CE Credit Hours** (as approved by accrediting body)
- **Approval Documentation** (approval letter, certificate, or screenshot)
- **Expiration Date** (if applicable - many approvals expire annually)

**Submission Method:**

- Upload via Instructor Dashboard → Course Settings → CE Accreditation
- Our team verifies the approval number with the accrediting body
- Once verified, "CE Credits Available" badge appears on your course

#### Step 4: Maintain Compliance

**Your Ongoing Responsibilities:**

- **Renew CE approval** annually or as required
- **Report CE participants** to accrediting body if required
- **Issue CE certificates** to students who complete course
- **Keep records** for audits (usually 4-6 years)
- **Notify Doctrina LMS** if CE approval expires or is revoked

### Financial Considerations

**Costs to Become CE Provider:**

- **ANCC (Nurses):** $1,500-$3,000 application + $500-$1,000 annual
- **ACCME (Physicians):** $2,000-$5,000 application + $1,000-$2,000 annual
- **State Nursing Boards:** $100-$500 application + $50-$200 annual
- **State Esthetics Boards:** $100-$500 application + $50-$200 annual
- **Course Approvals:** $0-$500 per course (varies)
- **Ongoing:** Record-keeping, reporting, renewals

**Revenue Potential:**

- Courses offering CE credits typically command 20-40% premium pricing
- Example: Non-CE course $1,500 vs. CE course $2,000
- Extra $500 x 20 students = $10,000 additional revenue
- **ROI:** CE accreditation investment pays for itself quickly

**Pricing Examples for Medical Aesthetics Courses:**

- **Advanced Botox Certification (Non-CE):** $1,800
- **Advanced Botox Certification (with 8 CE credits):** $2,400
- **Premium:** $600 per student x 30 students = $18,000 additional annual revenue

### Common Instructor Questions

#### Q: Is it hard to become a CE provider?

**A:** It depends on the accrediting body:

- **State boards:** Often easier, faster, and cheaper (weeks, $100-300)
- **National accreditation (ANCC, ACCME):** More rigorous, slower, more expensive (months, $1,500-$5,000)

Start with state board approval for your primary state. Expand to national accreditation if teaching students nationwide.

#### Q: Can I offer CE credits on Doctrina LMS if I'm already a CE provider elsewhere?

**A:** Yes! If you have CE provider approval (from teaching at a hospital, medical spa, university, or another platform), you can offer those same approved courses on Doctrina LMS. Just submit your existing CE approval documentation.

#### Q: What if my CE approval expires?

**A:** You must notify Doctrina LMS immediately. We will remove the "CE Credits Available" badge from your course until you submit proof of renewal. Students who completed the course before expiration still receive CE certificates with the approval that was valid at the time.

#### Q: Can I partner with a CE provider instead of getting my own approval?

**A:** Yes! Many instructors partner with existing accredited CE providers:

- Hospital or university CE departments
- Medical spa chains with CE approval
- Medical associations with CE approval
- Independent CE accreditation companies

The CE provider approves your course and issues certificates. You split CE fees with them (typically 20-40%). Submit their approval documentation to Doctrina LMS.

#### Q: Do I have to offer CE credits on my courses?

**A:** No! Many successful instructors on Doctrina LMS do NOT offer CE credits. Students take courses for skill development, practice expansion, and income potential - not just CE compliance. CE credits are a nice bonus but not required to teach excellent courses.

**Popular Non-CE Courses:**

- Business and marketing for medical aesthetics
- Social media strategies for practitioners
- Practice management and client retention
- Advanced technique workshops
- Non-licensed aesthetic services (for estheticians)
