---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Market Problem

**For Students (Nurses, Estheticians, Physicians, PAs):**

- **Skill Gap:** Medical aesthetics training is fragmented and expensive ($2,000-$10,000 per course)
- **Credibility Issues:** Many online courses lack proper credentials or CE credits
- **Access Barriers:** In-person training requires travel and time off work
- **Quality Variance:** No marketplace filtering for instructor credentials
- **Limited Selection:** Few platforms specialize in medical aesthetics

**For Instructors (Experienced Practitioners):**

- **High Platform Fees:** Udemy takes 50-63% commission, Teachable $0-$119/month + payment fees
- **No Credibility Support:** Platforms don't verify credentials or help with CE accreditation
- **Marketing Burden:** Instructors must drive all their own traffic
- **Complex Setup:** Building courses on generic LMS platforms is time-consuming
- **Limited Analytics:** Poor insights into student progress and engagement

### Solution

A **specialized marketplace** that:

- **Verifies all instructors** (license, insurance, credentials)
- **Supports CE credits** (displays accreditation, helps with certificates)
- **Provides better economics** (7-18% commission vs. 50%+)
- **Simplifies course creation** (wizard-guided, templates)
- **Ensures quality** (completion tracking, student feedback)

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Low Instructor Signups

**Owner:** Legal + Compliance Teams

---

### Risk 5: Video Hosting Costs Exceed Budget

## 12. Open Questions

1. **Pricing Strategy:** Should we allow instructors to set any price, or enforce minimum/maximum?
   - **Proposal:** Minimum $50 (ensures quality), maximum $5,000 (market-based)

2. **Refund Policy:** 30 days is generous but protects students. Should we add conditions?
   - **Proposal:** 30-day refund if <25% course complete (prevents abuse)

3. **CE Credit Verification:** How thorough should we be?
   - **Proposal:** Verify provider number with accrediting body when possible, but instructor responsible for validity

4. **Instructor Tiers:** Should we auto-upgrade instructors based on sales, or make them choose tier?
   - **Proposal:** Let instructors choose tier, but suggest upgrades when they hit revenue thresholds

5. **Course Approval:** Should all courses go through admin review, or trust approved instructors?
   - **Proposal:** First 3 courses reviewed, then auto-publish for trusted instructors
